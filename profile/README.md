## Description

This is the repository containing the open-source code underlying _luox_ (https://luox.app/).

The purpose of the _luox_ platform is to faciliate the calculation of quantities related to light and lighting in a user-friendly, open-access and free fashion. Users can upload spectra (which are only stored in the browser) and the platform will calculate relevant quantites (including (il)luminance, chromaticity, and α-opic (ir)radiance and α-opic daylight (il)luminances) from the spectra, generate a visualisation of the spectrum, and enable the export of calculations in tabular form. All default quantities reported here are supported by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

The platform is primarily geared towards researchers and research users interested in the effects of light exposure on human physiology and behaviour, but it may be interesting to students, academics and professionals in other disciplines and areas.

_luox_ is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
